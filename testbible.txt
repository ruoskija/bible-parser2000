THIS IS AN OLD TESTAMENT TITLE, IT IS NOT TO BE INCLUDED
	This is a new testament title and it is not included.

1Moos. 1:1 This is the first line.
1Moos. 1:2 This is the second line. It has two sentences.
1Moos. 1:3 The third line is broken up
into two pieces, but looks like a single line after being processed.
1Moos 1:4 A chapter is the first word of the line. It has no period in it.
1MOOS. 1:5 The chapter is lowercase, e.g. "1moos"
1moos 1:6. A verse is the second word. It contains only numbers and special characters.
1moos. 1:7. The verses do not contain periods.
1moos 1:8 A chapter and a verse are followed by the delimiter string you picked.
1moos 1:9 I recommend '%' as the Finnish bible does not contain any percent signs.

2moos 1:1 This

is

a single


line.

Ilm 1:337 No empty lines in this file (excluding first row).
    joh 56:78 This line starts with empty space. It is included without the empty space.


	3Moos 12:34 This title is not included, even if it has a verse.
